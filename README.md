## Site Structure 
The project comprises three pages - Home Page, which has existing entries displayed and cathegories listed for the user to choose from. The user can select a category under which an entry would be made. New Entry page allows users to create a new entry, set up a due date, if required, and mark it as urgent.

## Features
- #### New Entry
  - Located on the top right of the page and will take user to the page, where a new entry can be created.

- #### Home Page
  - Located on the top right of the page and has all categories displayed.

- #### Login/Register
  - It would allow users to log in to their personal profiles or create a new account if they are first-time users.
  
### Features to add  
- I would like to add an authentication method for the logged-in/new users, so when selecting a category, a new user wold be directed to the Register page, and existing user would be directed to New Entry page.
- I would like to add a Profile page displaying all existing entries. The page would also provide basic information about the user.
- I woudl like to create a more diary-style interface, with a cathegory and date picker at top and large entry window underneath it.
- I would like to improve visuals of the page for easier navigation
- I would like to link this app with external sources, for increased interactivity
- I would like extra features to each category, like BMI calculator, Food Calories calculator, Sleep Pattern calculator, and Exercise charts, to make it more dynamic and personal. 

## Testing 
When I initially tried to test my project on external device, the link didn't work. After spending some time trying to find te issue, I decided to transfer this project to another repository. 

## Deployments 
### Github 
This website was deployed to GitHub using the following steps:
1. In the Github repository, navigate to Settings
2. Then, navigate to the Pages tab 
3. Under the Source, select the branch to master and click Save
4. Once the page is refreshed, the link will appear, indicating the website is now live

### Forking the GitHub repository 
A copy of the GitHub repository can be created to allow viewing and modification without affecting the original repository.
1. Locate the repository
2. On the right-hand side of the page opposite your repository name is a button called 'Fork'
3. Click it to have a copy of the repository saved to your GitHub account

### Creating a local clone 
1. Locate the repository
2. Find a 'Code' button and click on the arrow 
3. To clone with HTTPS, click on the clipboard to copy the URL
4. In the Gitpod, change the directory to the chosen location
5. Type git clone, and then paste the URL from step 3
6. Press 'enter' to have a local clone created
